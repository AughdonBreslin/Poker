 - Classify player's hand as RRo, RRs, or RR
 - How to run through boards:
    - Brute force
       - (48 * 47 * 46) * (45) * (44)
       - 
    - Try to shortcut via suits:
       - If A and B have same suits, runouts are either that suit or not
          - How do i deal with 222 flop? Required to multiply by possible combos, could make it worse than brute force
          - However, I'd only need to run this case for 1/4 suits and then paste it over!

    - Only grab cards that will change hand strength
       - If there's one card left, check if straight flush possible, quads possible, etc. down to OPP's hand strength.
       - If there's two cards left, check for running cards that improve your hand - cards that improve OPP's hand more significantly
       - How do i get to first three cards?
          - First card can be all 52 (minus drawn)
          - Second card can be all 52 (minus drawn)
          - Third card may start to cut off straight flushes
          - Fourth card may start to cut off quads, boats, flushes, straights
          - Fifth card may start to cut off trips, two pairs
